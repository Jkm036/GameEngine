# Game Engine

This is a game engine I am making completely in C++. I plan to explore computer graphics, matrix math, tools such as Open GL specifcally GLFW and GLEW and much more. This is my current project and as of May 30th 2023  I plan to have it done (or make a majority of my progress) by June 20th 2023.

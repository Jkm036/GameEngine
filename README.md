# GameEngine
  I am currently working on a game engine modelled after 'The Cherno's sparky tutotial series. Note this is a project
for the sake of learning more about C++. Although I'm only going to write code I fully understand from the tutorial, none of this code
is purely original. I am working in visual studio community.
